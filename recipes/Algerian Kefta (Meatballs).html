<p>This is a great recipe for the holidays; it tastes great and it feels like fall when you drink it.<br>
 It is similar to the Starbucks® Pumpkin Spice Latte, but I personally like this better. Top<br>
 with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.</p>


<p>
<Ul> <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
    <li>½ salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ras el hanout (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
</Ul> </p>

<OL> <h3>Directions</h3>

<li> <h4>Step 1</h4>
    Combine the ground beef with half of the minced garlic and a tablespoon of<br>
    chopped onion. Mix with your hands until fully incorporated. Shape the meat <br>
    mixture into 1 1/2-inch oblong patties; you should have 12 to 14 meatballs.</li>
     
<li><h4> Step 2 </h4>
    Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the patties in batches <br>
    until they are crispy on both sides and are no longer pink in the center,<br>
    about 10 minutes. Set the meatballs aside in a rimmed serving dish and repeat<br>
    with the remaining patties..</li>

<li><h4> Step 3 </h4>
    Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the remaining chopped onion.<br>
    Add salt and pepper. Cook the onions in the drippings, stirring constantly,<br>
     until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in<br>
      the remaining half of the garlic and cook for 30 seconds..</li>
<li><h4> Step 4 </h4>
    Stir in the roma tomatoes, dried parsley, ras el hanout, and water. Cook until the <br>
    tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour the tomato sauce over the meatballs and serve.</li>
